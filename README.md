# budgeter-api

### Well, it was fun while it lasted. The whole point of this project was to:
1. Learn React Native
2. Improve React skills
3. Get experience with a cloud platform 
   - Started with AWS
   - Then went to GCP
4. Host API's in the cloud and continuously deliver updates
5. Deploy an app to my mobile phone
6. Build my own authentication

### Mission accomplished. And then I decided to add more missions.
1. Learn GraphQL. 
2. Get experience with testing
   - Functional tests with Postman Newman
   - Unit tests with Jest
3. Database experience
   - Started with FaunaDB
   - Then, moved to MongoDB
   - Messed around with Neo4J, too
4. Infrastructure as code frameworks 
   - Terraform

### I still have the desire to add version 100. But, I have so many other things I'd like to mess around with.
### I'm archiving this repo to put an end to this project but be able to reference any of my learnings here.
